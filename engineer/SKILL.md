# Workflow Guides

## Overview
Provide repeatable workflow sequences that chain skills and document required outputs.

## How to Use
1. Read `references/workflows.md` and select the workflow that matches the request.
2. Confirm scope (frontend/backend/docs) and required artifacts before starting.
3. Execute each step in order; log cross-repo impacts in `docs/Action_Items.md`.

## Output Requirements
- Use the exact workflow definitions from `references/workflows.md`.
- If a step is blocked, record the blocker and continue with what is possible.

## Resources
- `references/workflows.md` contains the authoritative workflow definitions.
