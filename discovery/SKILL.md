# Discovery

## Overview
Capture requirements and constraints, then generate a structured requirements pack in docs/.

## Workflow
1. Read `references/discovery.md` for required inputs, outputs, and rules.
2. Ask minimal missing questions (<=6) or proceed with explicit assumptions.
3. Produce every required file under `docs/requirements/feature-name/` with concise, testable content.
4. Log cross-repo impacts and divergences in `docs/Action_Items.md`.

## Output Requirements
- Always create the full requirements pack listed in `references/discovery.md`.
- Cite evidence or mark items as assumptions when inputs are missing.

## Resources
- `references/discovery.md` is the authoritative prompt and deliverables.
